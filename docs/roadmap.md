# Roadmap

## 1. Roadmap principles

TunWarden development must prioritize safety before feature breadth.

The roadmap is intentionally staged so that privileged networking is implemented only after planning, rollback, diagnostics, and recovery behavior are designed and testable.

Important ordering rule:

> Do not add convenience features that hide networking state before the client can reliably connect, disconnect, diagnose, roll back, and recover.

## 2. Current repository state

The repository currently contains a foundation build:

- `tunwarden` CLI skeleton,
- `tunwardend` daemon skeleton,
- read-only `doctor` command contract,
- dry-run `panic-reset` command contract,
- initial transaction/profile/subscription models,
- CI with `gofmt` and `go test`,
- canonical documentation under `docs/`.

The repository does **not** yet contain:

- real Xray process management,
- profile import,
- subscription parsing,
- TUN creation,
- route/DNS/nftables mutation,
- systemd unit files,
- real daemon IPC.

## 3. Phase 0: Documentation and repository foundation

Status: mostly complete.

Goal: define the project before writing privileged code.

Deliverables:

- documentation index,
- product requirements,
- architecture requirements,
- networking/reliability requirements,
- subscription/profile requirements,
- development guide,
- technical references,
- initial CI skeleton,
- initial CLI/daemon skeleton.

Exit criteria:

- MVP scope is clear.
- Non-goals are documented.
- Networking invariants are documented.
- Panic reset and rollback are treated as first-class requirements.
- Documentation has one canonical location per concern.

## 4. Phase 1: CLI, daemon, and local IPC foundation

Goal: create the basic process model without risky networking changes.

Deliverables:

- `tunwarden` command structure,
- `tunwardend` daemon process,
- local IPC design and implementation,
- restricted daemon API,
- systemd service draft,
- journald logging,
- `status` command,
- `logs` command,
- structured error model,
- daemon startup recovery scan in read-only mode.

Exit criteria:

- CLI can communicate with daemon.
- Daemon can run under systemd.
- Logs are visible through `journalctl` and `tunwarden logs`.
- No privileged networking changes are performed yet.
- Read-only recovery scan can report stale TunWarden-owned state without removing it.

## 5. Phase 2: Profile and subscription foundation

Goal: import and normalize profiles before connecting anything.

Deliverables:

- internal profile model,
- manual profile support,
- share link parser for initial protocols,
- Base64 subscription parser,
- subscription storage,
- update diff,
- validation and warnings,
- fixture-based tests.

Initial protocols:

- VLESS,
- VMess,
- Trojan,
- Shadowsocks.

Exit criteria:

- Profiles can be imported, listed, shown, validated, and deleted.
- Subscription update failure preserves last known good state.
- Unsupported formats fail clearly.
- Unsafe profile settings are reported as warnings rather than silently accepted.

## 6. Phase 3: Xray engine lifecycle in proxy-only mode

Goal: start and stop Xray safely without touching system routes, DNS, TUN, or firewall state.

Deliverables:

- Xray engine manager,
- generated runtime config under `/run/tunwarden/`,
- local SOCKS/HTTP/mixed inbound where supported,
- core process supervision,
- graceful stop,
- forced stop,
- core logs,
- basic health check,
- proxy-only `connect` and `disconnect`.

Exit criteria:

- A manual profile can run in proxy-only mode.
- The daemon can stop Xray cleanly.
- Core crash is detected and reported.
- No system routes, DNS, firewall rules, or TUN devices are modified.
- Generated Xray config is runtime output, not persistent source of truth.

## 7. Phase 4: Network planner and dry-run

Goal: design network changes without applying them.

Deliverables:

- system snapshot model,
- route planner,
- DNS planner,
- firewall planner,
- TUN planner,
- transaction model,
- `tunwarden plan <profile>`,
- planner unit tests,
- fake system snapshots for common desktop topologies.

Exit criteria:

- A full-tunnel plan can be generated from a fake system snapshot.
- Plan output is readable by technical users.
- Planner can detect route loop risk.
- Planner can produce rollback steps.
- Planner can explain warnings for DNS, IPv6, NetworkManager, and kill-switch behavior.

## 8. Phase 5: Safe TUN MVP

Goal: implement full-tunnel mode with rollback.

Deliverables:

- TUN interface creation,
- routing table/rule apply,
- systemd-resolved DNS apply,
- nftables foundation,
- transaction apply/commit/rollback,
- `panic-reset --execute` or equivalent explicit destructive mode,
- `doctor` checks for route/DNS/TUN/firewall/core state,
- integration tests in Linux network namespaces where possible.

Exit criteria:

- Failed connection attempts roll back.
- Disconnect leaves no TunWarden-owned routes, rules, DNS, nftables state, TUN interfaces, generated configs, or child processes.
- `panic-reset` works when disconnected and after simulated failure.
- VPN server route bypasses TUN.
- Strict kill-switch behavior is explicit and recoverable.

## 9. Phase 6: Laptop reliability

Goal: make the client robust on real Linux laptops.

Deliverables:

- NetworkManager event handling,
- default route/interface change handling,
- DNS change handling,
- suspend/resume hooks,
- reconnect state machine,
- rate-limited retries,
- health checks after resume,
- Ubuntu LTS manual test checklist.

Exit criteria:

- Active connection recovers after suspend/resume.
- Active connection recovers after Wi-Fi reconnect.
- DHCP/DNS changes are handled without stale state.
- NetworkManager limited connectivity is reported but not blindly treated as VPN failure.
- Reconnect loops are rate-limited and observable.

## 10. Phase 7: Packaging

Goal: make installation and service management reliable.

Deliverables:

- `.deb` package,
- systemd units,
- default config files,
- uninstall cleanup policy,
- shell completions,
- man pages later,
- Fedora/Arch packaging plan.

Exit criteria:

- Fresh Ubuntu installation can install, start daemon, connect, disconnect, run `doctor`, run `panic-reset`, and uninstall safely.
- Package removal has a documented cleanup policy.

## 11. Phase 8: Advanced features

Goal: add convenience only after reliability is solid.

Candidates:

- latency test,
- URL test,
- auto-select,
- split tunnel,
- routing rule DSL,
- IPv6 full support,
- AmneziaWG engine,
- optional sing-box compatibility experiments,
- GUI client,
- provider-specific subscription metadata,
- auto-update core with signature/checksum verification.

## 12. Explicit deferrals

The following should not be started until the earlier reliability phases are strong:

- GUI,
- mobile clients,
- complex visual routing editor,
- router mode,
- plugin system,
- broad non-Xray protocol expansion,
- automatic privileged core updater.

## 13. First milestone proposal
