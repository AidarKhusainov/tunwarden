# TunWarden documentation

This directory is the source of truth for TunWarden product and engineering documentation.

TunWarden is a Linux-first, CLI-first VPN/proxy client for Xray-compatible configurations. The project prioritizes safe Linux networking, explicit recovery, and deterministic behavior for technical users over early GUI features or broad protocol expansion.

## Product thesis

TunWarden should not be “another Xray GUI”. It should be a Linux networking tool that treats VPN activation as a reversible transaction.

The primary value proposition is:

> A lightweight Linux-first Xray client that does not leave the machine without recoverable networking after crashes, failed connects, sleep/resume, Wi-Fi changes, DNS changes, or route changes.

## Initial platform scope

### Tier 1

- Ubuntu LTS desktop.
- Debian stable desktop.
- systemd.
- NetworkManager.
- systemd-resolved.
- nftables.
- iproute2.
- Linux TUN device.

### Tier 2

- Fedora Workstation.
- Arch Linux.
- systemd-networkd where practical.

### Out of initial scope

- GUI.
- Mobile platforms.
- Windows/macOS.
- Router distributions.
- Non-systemd Linux distributions.
- Complex enterprise policy management.

## Non-negotiable design principles

1. **No blind system mutation.** Every privileged networking operation must be planned, logged, and reversible.
2. **Rollback and recovery first.** Cleanup and recovery must exist before advanced full-tunnel features are considered stable.
3. **CLI-first.** The first UX is a stable command-line tool.
4. **Daemon-owned privilege:** Privileged networking belongs in the daemon, not in a SUID GUI/client binary.
5. **Observable by default.** Users must be able to inspect routes, DNS, firewall state, core process status, and connection health while respecting the documented output policy.
6. **Linux networking is dynamic.** Sleep/resume, Wi-Fi roaming, DHCP changes, DNS changes, and interface changes are normal events.
7. **NetworkManager connectivity is advisory.** Desktop connectivity indicators may be wrong while the VPN data path still works; TunWarden must run independent health checks.
8. **Small reliable core before convenience.** Proxy-only and safe TUN foundations come before GUI, auto-select, complex routing UI, and additional engines.

## Canonical command shape

The canonical command contract is maintained in [CLI contract](./cli.md). Short examples:

```bash
# first-run import
tunwarden import <uri-or-file-or-url>

# explicit resources
tunwarden profile add --name test --server example.com --port 443 --protocol vless
tunwarden profile import '<share-uri>'
tunwarden profile list
tunwarden profile show <profile-id>
tunwarden subscription add --name personal --url file:///tmp/sub.txt
tunwarden subscription list
tunwarden subscription update <subscription-id>

# connection lifecycle
tunwarden connect [--mode proxy-only] <profile-id>
tunwarden connect --mode tun <profile-id>
tunwarden disconnect
tunwarden status
tunwarden doctor
tunwarden logs

# safety and recovery
tunwarden plan --mode proxy-only <profile-id>
tunwarden plan --mode tun <profile-id>
tunwarden recover
tunwarden recover --execute --yes
```

## Definition of done for early development

The first implementation is not ready until the following are true:

- `tunwarden recover` can inspect recovery candidates after an interrupted connection attempt.
- `tunwarden doctor` can explain route, DNS, TUN, firewall, core, daemon, and NetworkManager status.
- The daemon can survive or recover from core process crashes.
- The connection can be re-established after suspend/resume and Wi-Fi reconnection.
- A failed connection attempt cannot leave stale routes, rules, DNS settings, nftables rules, generated configs, or core processes behind.
