# nftables Firewall Executor

This document describes the implemented nftables executor slice for TUN transactions.

The canonical networking invariants remain owned by [Networking and Reliability Requirements](./networking-reliability.md). This document records the concrete executor behavior added for TunWarden-owned firewall state.

## Ownership boundary

TunWarden creates and mutates only this nftables object tree:

```text
table inet tunwarden
```

TunWarden must not mutate user-owned nftables tables, chains, or rules outside `inet tunwarden`.

The initial executor owns one output chain inside that table:

```text
chain output {
  type filter hook output priority 0; policy accept;
}
```

Rules are marked with explicit TunWarden comments:

```text
tunwarden:firewall:server-bypass
tunwarden:firewall:tun-egress
tunwarden:firewall:kill-switch
```

These markers are part of the inspectable desired state and the verification contract.

## Planned rules

For a concrete VPN server IP, the executor installs the planner-provided server bypass rule before non-TUN blocking:

```text
ip daddr <server-ip> counter comment "tunwarden:firewall:server-bypass" accept
```

TUN egress is allowed explicitly:

```text
oifname "tunwarden0" counter comment "tunwarden:firewall:tun-egress" accept
```

The kill-switch rule depends on the selected planner policy:

```text
oifname != "tunwarden0" counter comment "tunwarden:firewall:kill-switch" reject  # soft
oifname != "tunwarden0" counter comment "tunwarden:firewall:kill-switch" drop    # strict
```

For `off`, the kill-switch blocking rule is skipped.

## Apply order

The daemon transaction applies networking state in this order:

1. TUN interface, routes, and policy rules.
2. systemd-resolved per-link DNS.
3. TunWarden-owned nftables table, chain, and rules.
4. Verification before transaction commit.

If nftables apply fails after creating partial state, the executor removes `inet tunwarden` immediately. The transaction then rolls back the already-recorded DNS, route, policy-rule, and TUN steps.

## Verification

Before commit, the executor runs:

```bash
nft list table inet tunwarden
```

Verification requires:

- the planned chain to be visible;
- every planned rule expression to be visible;
- every planned verdict to be visible;
- every TunWarden ownership comment to be visible.

A failed verification triggers transaction rollback.

## Rollback and disconnect cleanup

Rollback deletes the whole TunWarden-owned table:

```bash
nft delete table inet tunwarden
```

This is intentionally idempotent. Missing-table errors are treated as already-clean state.

Disconnect uses transaction rollback metadata to remove `inet tunwarden` before DNS, route, policy-rule, and TUN cleanup. Recovery commands that execute cleanup must use the same ownership boundary: remove TunWarden-owned nftables state, not arbitrary firewall state.

## Existing table behavior

If snapshot/planner state reports that `inet tunwarden` already exists before apply, the current executor does not silently validate-or-replace it. The connect transaction fails before firewall mutation so the user can inspect or recover stale TunWarden-owned state explicitly.
