# Architecture

## 1. Architectural goal

TunWarden must separate unprivileged user interaction from privileged Linux networking operations.

The architecture must make dangerous operations explicit, observable, reversible, and testable.

## 2. High-level components

```

## 3. Process model

### 3.1 CLI

The CLI must be unprivileged.

Responsibilities:

- parse user commands,
- render status and diagnostics,
- submit requests to daemon,
- print plans and errors,
- never directly mutate routes, DNS, nftables, or TUN state.

### 3.2 Daemon

The daemon must run as root under systemd.

Responsibilities:

- validate user requests,
- manage privileged operations,
- own connection state,
- manage core process lifecycle,
- perform network transactions,
- handle cleanup and recovery,
- expose a restricted local API.

### 3.3 Core process

Xray should be treated as a child engine process, not as the application supervisor.

Responsibilities:

- execute proxy protocols,
- apply generated Xray config,
- expose logs/stats if configured,
- terminate cleanly on daemon request.

The core must not be the only holder of network state. TunWarden must know what system-level changes were applied.

## 4. Privilege boundary

TunWarden must not use a SUID GUI/client binary as the primary privilege model.

Preferred model:

```text
systemd service: tunwardend.service
user command: tunwarden
IPC: Unix socket or D-Bus
optional authorization: polkit
```

The daemon API must be intentionally small.

Initial API operations:

- `Status()`
- `PlanConnect(profile_id)`
- `Connect(profile_id)`
- `Disconnect()`
- `Reconnect()`
- `Doctor()`
- `PanicReset()`
- `ListProfiles()`
- `ImportSubscription(source)`

## 5. State model

TunWarden must distinguish persistent state from volatile state.

### 5.1 Persistent state

Suggested location:

```text
/var/lib/tunwarden/
```

Contents:

- profiles,
- subscriptions,
- subscription cache,
- user preferences,
- known provider metadata,
- last successful profile ID.

### 5.2 Volatile runtime state

Suggested location:

```text
/run/tunwarden/
```

Contents:

- active connection state,
- pending transaction state,
- applied transaction ID,
- generated core config,
- daemon socket,
- health status,
- lock files.

### 5.3 Logs

Use journald as the primary logging destination.

The CLI may provide:

```bash
tunwarden logs
tunwarden logs --follow
tunwarden logs --core
tunwarden logs --network
```

## 6. Transaction model

All network changes must happen through a transaction object.

```text
NetworkTransaction
  id
  profile_id
  started_at
  state: planned | applying | verifying | committed | rolling_back | rolled_back | failed
  before_snapshot
  desired_plan
  applied_steps
  rollback_steps
  health_result
```

Required flow:

```text
1. Build plan
2. Acquire global network lock
3. Snapshot relevant state
4. Write pending transaction to /run/tunwarden
5. Apply steps in deterministic order
6. Verify health
7. Commit transaction
8. Remove pending marker or mark committed
```

If verification fails:

```text
1. Mark transaction as rolling_back
2. Execute rollback steps in reverse order
3. Verify direct connectivity if possible
4. Mark rolled_back or failed
```

On daemon startup:

```text
1. Read /run/tunwarden pending/active transaction state
2. Detect stale TunWarden-owned system state
3. Recover committed active connection or clean up incomplete transaction
4. Never assume previous daemon shutdown was clean
```

## 7. Planner/executor split

Network logic must be split into planners and executors.

### Planner

Pure or mostly pure code. Does not require root.

Inputs:

- current system snapshot,
- profile,
- daemon settings,
- platform capabilities.

Output:

- desired network plan,
- ordered apply steps,
- ordered rollback steps,
- warnings.

### Executor

Privileged code. Executes a validated plan.

Executors:

- `TunExecutor`,
- `RouteExecutor`,
- `DnsExecutor`,
- `FirewallExecutor`,
- `CoreExecutor`,
- `NetworkManagerExecutor`.

## 8. Engine abstraction

TunWarden starts as Xray-first but should not make networking depend on Xray internals.

```text
VpnEngine
  GenerateConfig(profile, runtime_network_state) -> EngineConfig
  Start(config) -> EngineHandle
  Stop(handle) -> StopResult
  Health(handle) -> EngineHealth
  Logs(handle) -> LogStream
```

Initial engine:

- `XrayEngine`

Future engines:

- `AmneziaWgEngine`,
- `SingBoxEngine` if needed for compatibility/testing.

## 9. Network backends

TunWarden must support backend interfaces rather than hard-coding one environment.

```text
RouteBackend
  iproute2 implementation

DnsBackend
  systemd-resolved implementation
  resolvconf implementation later
  raw resolv.conf fallback only as last resort

FirewallBackend
  nftables implementation
  iptables fallback later only if needed

NetworkEventBackend
  NetworkManager implementation
  rtnetlink implementation
  systemd sleep hook implementation
```

## 10. Configuration generation

Generated core config must be treated as runtime output, not as the source of truth.

Source of truth:

```text
TunWarden profile model
TunWarden routing policy
TunWarden DNS policy
TunWarden runtime state
```

Generated files may live under:

```text
/run/tunwarden/generated/
```

## 11. Error handling principles

- Prefer explicit failure over silent partial success.
- Every failed apply step must include the command/operation, stderr, and rollback impact.
- Cleanup must be idempotent.
- Core crashes must not imply system networking cleanup was completed.
- NetworkManager limited connectivity must not automatically be treated as connection failure.

## 12. Testing architecture

Required test layers:

1. Unit tests for profile parsing and normalization.
2. Unit tests for route/DNS/firewall planners.
3. Integration tests in Linux network namespaces.
4. VM tests for Ubuntu/Debian/Fedora.
5. Suspend/resume simulation where possible.
6. Failure injection tests:
   - core crash,
   - daemon crash,
   - DNS apply failure,
   - route apply failure,
   - nft apply failure,
   - Wi-Fi/default route change.

## 13. Future GUI rule

A future GUI must be a client of the daemon API.

It must not:

- run as root,
- directly modify system networking,
- own the connection lifecycle independently from the daemon,
- become required for recovery.
