# Subscriptions and profiles

TunWarden stores user-owned subscription sources separately from normalized profiles. Subscription fetches and local imports are normalized into the same profile model that connection planning and daemon lifecycle use.

Generated Xray configuration is runtime output. It is not the persistent source of truth for imported profiles or subscriptions.

## State model

Profiles are stored under the documented user state directory:

```text
$XDG_STATE_HOME/tunwarden/profiles.json
```

When `XDG_STATE_HOME` is unset, the fallback is:

```text
~/.local/state/tunwarden/profiles.json
```

Subscription metadata is stored alongside user state:

```text
$XDG_STATE_HOME/tunwarden/subscriptions.json
```

Subscription metadata contains the local subscription ID, name, source URL, detected format, imported profile IDs, and last successful update time. User-facing output must redact full subscription URLs and provider tokens.

## Subscription sources

Supported source schemes:

- `file://`
- `http://`
- `https://`

HTTP(S) subscription fetches send:

```text
User-Agent: TunWarden
```

The User-Agent identifies TunWarden without pretending to be another client and must not include provider tokens, user identities, operating-system details, device details, or other fine-grained fingerprinting data.

Subscription fetches are bounded, read-only operations. They must not connect to the VPN, start `tunwardend`, start Xray, require root, create TUN devices, mutate routes, mutate DNS, mutate nftables, or mutate firewall state.

## Subscription formats

Supported response formats:

- Base64 URI-list
- Xray JSON object
- Xray JSON array

Format detection uses the response body, not the HTTP `Content-Type` header. After trimming whitespace:

- `{` starts the Xray JSON object path;
- `[` starts the Xray JSON array path;
- malformed JSON that starts with `{` or `[` fails as JSON and must not fall back to Base64;
- other content is parsed as Base64 URI-list.

The detected format is persisted in subscription metadata after a successful import or update and is shown by `subscription list` and `subscription show`.

## Normalization

Subscription entries are normalized into TunWarden profiles with source `subscription`.

Supported Xray JSON import covers VLESS outbounds that map to the normalized profile model. Each supported outbound is converted into a profile containing server, port, protocol, identity, transport, security, TLS/Reality, WebSocket, and gRPC fields that TunWarden already understands.

Raw provider responses and raw Xray JSON are not stored as persistent profile source of truth.

Unsupported entries are reported clearly when at least one supported profile is imported. A response with no supported profiles fails and leaves existing state unchanged.

## Update behavior

A subscription update follows this sequence:

1. Fetch the source.
2. Detect the response format.
3. Parse and normalize supported profiles.
4. Validate normalized profiles.
5. Replace only profiles owned by that subscription.
6. Persist subscription metadata with the detected format, imported profile IDs, and update time.

Failed fetch, decode, parse, validation, profile replacement, or metadata update must preserve the last known good profiles and subscription metadata.

Duplicate profile IDs inside one subscription response fail the update. Unsupported protocol, transport, security, or incompatible transport/security combinations are reported as unsupported profile entries rather than silently accepted.

## CLI behavior

Import a one-off local file:

```bash
tunwarden import ./profiles.json
tunwarden import ./profiles.txt
```

Import a subscription through the first-run convenience entrypoint:

```bash
tunwarden import https://example.com/subscription
```

Manage an explicit subscription source:

```bash
tunwarden subscription add --name personal --url https://example.com/subscription
tunwarden subscription update personal
tunwarden subscription list
tunwarden subscription show personal
```

Human output for successful subscription import/update includes a concise detected format line:

```text
Format: base64
```

or:

```text
Format: xray-json
```

`subscription list --json` and `subscription show --json` expose the persisted format and redacted URL metadata with the common JSON envelope.

## Security requirements

Subscription and profile commands must not print full subscription URLs, full share URIs, raw user identities, passwords, private keys, authorization headers, provider tokens, or generated core configuration contents.

User-owned profile and subscription state must not require root and must not be hidden only in daemon-private directories.
