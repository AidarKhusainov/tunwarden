# TunWarden

TunWarden is a Linux-first CLI VPN/proxy client for Xray-compatible profiles and subscriptions.

It is built for technical users who want networking changes to be explicit, inspectable, reversible, and recoverable. The `tunwarden` CLI owns profile and subscription intent. The `tunwardend` daemon owns runtime lifecycle and daemon state.

Run `tunwarden` as the normal user for profile, subscription, import, plan, connect, and shell-completion workflows. Do not run user-state workflows through `sudo tunwarden`; privileged runtime changes are delegated to `tunwardend`.

## Scope

TunWarden targets Linux systems with standard networking and service-management tools:

- systemd and journald;
- NetworkManager;
- systemd-resolved;
- nftables and iproute2;
- Linux TUN;
- Xray-compatible profile and subscription inputs.

The core product path is CLI and daemon first. GUI clients, mobile platforms, router distributions, provider account management, and broad non-Xray protocol expansion are outside the core path until the Linux networking foundation is reliable.

## Safety model

TunWarden treats VPN activation as a recoverable transaction:

```text
plan -> snapshot -> apply -> verify -> commit
                             |
                             v
                          rollback
```

Safety rules:

- the CLI must not directly change privileged Linux networking state;
- proxy-only mode must not change TUN devices, routes, DNS, nftables, or firewall state;
- TUN/full-tunnel work must be daemon-owned, planned before mutation, verified before commit, and recoverable after failure;
- generated core configs are runtime output, not profile source of truth;
- status, diagnostics, logs, plans, and recovery output must redact secrets consistently.

## Build

```bash
go test ./...
go run ./cmd/tunwarden version
go run ./cmd/tunwardend
```

Build a local Debian package:

```bash
bash scripts/build-deb.sh
sudo apt install ./dist/tunwarden_0.0.0~dev-1_amd64.deb
```

The package installs binaries, systemd/sysusers files, shell completions, manual pages, and project documentation under packaged filesystem locations. It must not ship runtime state, generated core configs, user state, `/run/tunwarden`, or `/usr/local` files.

Packaged daemon access is group-mediated through the `tunwarden` group and the local `/run/tunwarden/tunwardend.sock` socket. The canonical access, ownership, and package lifecycle contracts are [State and security requirements](docs/state-and-security.md), [Architecture](docs/architecture.md), and [Debian package contract](docs/debian-package.md).

## Basic workflow

```bash
# Import one share URI, a local Xray JSON or URI-list file, or a subscription URL.
tunwarden import <share-uri-or-local-path-or-file-http-url>

tunwarden profile list
tunwarden plan --mode proxy-only <profile-id>
tunwarden connect --mode proxy-only <profile-id>
tunwarden status
tunwarden logs
tunwarden disconnect
tunwarden recover
```

Local import files are parsed into normalized TunWarden profiles only. Import does not start `tunwardend`, start Xray, require root, mutate host networking, or persist raw Xray JSON.

Subscription imports and updates support Base64 URI-list and Xray JSON responses over `file://`, `http://`, and `https://` sources. The detected subscription format is persisted in subscription metadata and shown by `subscription list` and `subscription show` with full URLs redacted.

Use `tunwarden plan --mode tun <profile-id>` to inspect full-tunnel network intent before host networking work. Use `tunwarden doctor` for diagnostics and `tunwarden recover` to inspect TunWarden-owned stale state.

Generate shell completion definitions manually when needed:

```bash
tunwarden completion bash
tunwarden completion zsh
tunwarden completion fish
```

The Debian package installs bash, zsh, and fish completion files under distro completion directories, so normal packaged installs should not require manually editing shell startup files.

The canonical command contract is [CLI contract](docs/cli.md). Local import formats are documented in [Local import formats](docs/local-import-formats.md). Subscription behavior is documented in [Subscriptions and profiles](docs/subscriptions-and-profiles.md).
